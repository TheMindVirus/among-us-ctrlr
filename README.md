# among-us-ctrlr
A script to play Among Us (PC) on an Xbox One Controller with hotkey for muting/unmuting Discord

*This script is intended to be used with an Xbox One Controller via an Xbox One Wireless Adapter for Windows
and the Steam x86 Desktop Version of Among Us.*

**You may need to install Python 3 and the following pip packages to get it to work properly:**

`pip3 install XInput-Python pyautogui`

**You may also need to change the following line:**

`HID.FAILSAFE = True # Set this to False if the mouse gets stuck`

**To move around you can use the left analog stick for 8-position movement.**

**To control the game, hold down the left trigger and move the right stick to move the cursor.**

**Use the right trigger to click/hold so you can complete tasks.**

**The DPAD is for slight movement adjustments so you can look sus.**

**To mute/unmute Discord, press Back and it will momentarily blink Discord on screen and go back to the game.**


### Update

For this script to work Steam Controller Input needs to be switched off for Xbox Controllers in Steam Among Us Settings. \
This can be found in: Right Click Among Us -> Properties -> Controller -> Override For Among Us = Disable Steam Input


The script is in a barely usable state and is open to configuration to suit your own play-style.

Enjoy!
